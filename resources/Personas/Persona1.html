			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>
					Mr. Chen has heard of and tried out the application knowing it being a safe place for people with mental health issues.
					He has used the application as intended - to vent out his anxiety frustrations and try to get advice from people with similar issues.
					He was very pleased with the application and eventually used the private social part of the application to comunicate with new friends, however it seems that he had issues when it came to the friends folder customization, perhaps a simpler method will help.
					There were also issues in regards to the creation of new tags on his posts and it seems like the activity section UI was a bit confusing to him.
